# Nasal-temperature-sensing
I am developing a wireless breath monitoring device that uses the BME280 environmental sensor to detect inhalation and exhalation patterns by analyzing subtle changes in pressure near the nose or mouth. The data is processed using an ESP32 microcontroller, making the device fully wireless and capable of sending real-time data to the cloud for remote analysis and health monitoring.
### I am handling the firmware development, PCB design, and overall electronic system integration of the device. This includes:

Sensor interfacing and signal processing.

WiFi-enabled data transmission.

Cloud integration (e.g., Firebase, MQTT, or custom APIs).

Power optimization and embedded coding.

### Technologies Used:

BME280 Sensor (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)

ESP32 Microcontroller

WiFi + Cloud Communication

Custom PCB Design (Altium/KiCad)

Embedded C/C++ or Arduino Framework

### Applications:

Patient breathing pattern monitoring

Sleep apnea or respiratory disorder detection

Remote health tracking for elderly or ICU patients
